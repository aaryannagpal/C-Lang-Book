# The C Programming Language - K&R
I am new to C, and my courses absolutely require that I learn it asap. So I am gonna read this book, and write what I learn here, cause my one of prof said that he will grade us on our practise and github, not exams, and I need an A soo bad so here I am.

**CS-1203 TAs and TFs THIS IS MY C PROGRESS REPO**

Also, do not look at the latest commit time as I have done a lot of organising at the last moment, including changing folders and file names.
Do check out the history of commits that are there.
Also, there might be alot of commits that just disappeared cause I changed a lot of things (4th Oct), if you can find them, nice. Otherwise you gotta trust me on this that I have been putting commits almost daily.

Anyways, gimme an A pls.
